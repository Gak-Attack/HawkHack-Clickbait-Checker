# HawkHack-Title-Authenticator
Note: users will need to supply their own text document to use properly. 
This program will check what percentage of the words in a text can be found in the title of the project. The user will be prompted to enter a title, and enter the name of the text file the program will read from. The program, after reading through the text file, will show how often each word in the title appeared, and what percentage of the entire text file the title was a part of.
